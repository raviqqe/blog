# Pen and Go 2: Evolving languages

Evolving products is a hard way and it's the same for programming languages too. In this article, I describe how the Pen programming language is designed and why it took a different path from Go.

## The Pen programming language

Pen is the new programming language I've been developing over a half year. It focuses productivitiy

## Go 2

One of the most awaited features in Go 2 is generics (or formally parametric polymorphism.) I think it's difficult to add new features especially in programming languages in terms of product management because keeping language features orthogonal is very difficult.

Just as a side note, I wouldn't say Go 1 had no generics as a programming language.

## Developer experience and intelligence

Another notable point to consider for building a programming language is developers' intelligence.

## Conclusion

Pen took a path of evolution different from other languagges including Go 2 for the following reasons:

- It's focused on software engineering rather than programming. The longer time passes, the more important simplicity is.
- Generics has a tradeoff between developer experience and language complexity. Since Go 1 has been successfully used in a lot of applications without it, I would like to continue experimenting the path.
- My brain is not comparable with other developers, at least, like the ones described in "Hackers and Painters" by Paul Graham.
